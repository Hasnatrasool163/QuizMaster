Here are some thoughts on its importance:
Level 12:
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.-Harriet Tubman.Empowering Individuals: Civics education empowers individuals by providing them with a deep understanding of the structures and processes of government. This knowledge enables citizens to engage with their government in a meaningful way, make informed decisions, and hold elected officials accountable.Promoting Civic Participation: Civics education encourages active participation in civic affairs, fostering a sense of social responsibility and community engagement. By participating in activities such as volunteering, advocacy, and community service, individuals contribute to the betterment of society and help address pressing social issues.

Let us move forward with strong and active faith.-Franklin D.Roosevelt.Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills: Civics education cultivates critical thinking skills essential for evaluating information, analyzing complex issues, and forming reasoned opinions. In today's information-rich environment, the ability to critically evaluate sources and discern fact from opinion is crucial for informed decision-making.
Level 14:
Technology is best when it brings people together. It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.-Albert Einstein.Overall, the study of civics is crucial for fostering informed, engaged, and responsible citizens who are equipped to participate meaningfully in democratic societies. It empowers individuals to contribute to the common good, uphold democratic values, and work towards a more just and equitable world. As such, civics education is not only important for everyday life but also for the long-term health and vitality of democratic societies.Presentation of statistics or evidence to support the statement: "According to research from Stress.org, 77% of people regularly experience physical symptoms caused by stress."

Level 15:

Level 16:

Level 20:
A room without books is like a body without a soul. I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.-Groucho Marx.As has been noted, through free elections citizens of a democracy confer powers that are defined by law upon their leaders. In a constitutional democracy, the power of government is divided so that the legislature makes the laws, the executive authority carries them out, and the judiciary operates quasi-independently. These divisions are sometimes described as a "separation of powers." In actual practice, however, such divisions are rarely neat, and in most modern democratic states these powers are overlapping and shared as much as they are separated. Legislatures may attempt to manage programs through detailed regulations; executive offices routinely engage in detailed rulemaking; and both legislators and executive officers conduct judicial-style hearings on a wide range of issues.

Level 21:
Legislators may question government officials about their actions and decisions, approve national budgets, and confirm executive appointees to courts and ministries. In some democracies, legislative committees provide lawmakers a forum for these public examinations of national issues. Legislators may support the government in power or they may serve as a loyal political opposition that offers alternative policies and programs
The weakness of separately elected presidents and legislatures is a potential stalemate. Presidents may not possess enough political allies in the legislature to cast the votes to enact the policies they want, but by employing their veto power (the right of the executive under certain circumstances to annul laws passed by the legislature), they can prevent the legislature from enacting its own legislative programs. The late political scientist Richard Neustadt described presidential power in the United States as "not the power to command, but the power to persuade." What Neustadt meant is that a U.S. president who wants Congress to enact a legislative program to his liking—or at least to avoid laws he disagrees with being passed by political opponents—must command political popularity with the public, and be able to forge effective alliances in the Congress.
